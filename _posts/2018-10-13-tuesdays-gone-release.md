## Thank You to Those who have Contributed
We continue to thank those that have contributed to the ZoneMinder project. We are always in need of volunteers, not just to write code, but to help manage the user forum, manage wiki content, write documentation, test the latest master branch, etc. There is always far more work to do than people available to do the work.

## Bug Fix Release
This is a bug fix release that fixes issues of moderate severity.

Here is a summary:
- Additional fixes to zmtrigger
- Additional fixes to zmfilter
- remember navbar collapse selection
- don't build neon instructions on armel architecture
- don't refresh the page during an Ajax timeout error

## What's New
