As it has been over 18 months since the last release, now is probably a good time to post an update. ZoneMinder is not dead.

I have been working with a few others from the #zoneminder freenode IRC channel to move the code base over to [github](https://github.com/ZoneMinder/ZoneMinder/), with the goal of making this project more transparent. We would like to open up development to the community, and to allow direct issue, bug and feature request tracking, all of which github allows. Our immediate goal is to release ZoneMinder 1.26! The 1.26 release will support a number of bug fixes and performance improvement from community patches.

Head on over to [our github page](https://github.com/ZoneMinder/ZoneMinder/) to follow the development, [submit (or solve) a bug](https://github.com/ZoneMinder/ZoneMinder/issues/), or contribute to the code! We are currently developing in [a number of branches](https://github.com/ZoneMinder/ZoneMinder/branches), which will eventually be merged for a beta release, followed by a merge to the master branch and tagged for a 1.26 stable release.
