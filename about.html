<p>ZoneMinder is an integrated set of applications which provide a complete surveillance solution allowing capture, analysis, recording and monitoring of any CCTV or security cameras attached to a Linux based machine. It is designed to run on distributions which support the Video For Linux (V4L) interface and has been tested with video cameras attached to BTTV cards, various USB cameras and also supports most IP network cameras. A partial list is given in the Wiki and Support sections, please give feedback in the Forums if it works with yours. ZoneMinder also requires MySQL and PHP, and is enhanced by a webserver such as Apache.</p>

<p>ZoneMinder is highly componentised and comprises both the back-end daemons which do the actual image capture and analysis and a user friendly web GUI enabling you to both monitor the current situation and view and organise historical events that have taken place. The web GUI allows you to check and control your ZoneMinder installation from other computers in your home or from anywhere in the world. ZoneMinder does not require X at all, or the web interface for day-to-day functions and so is also suitable for 'headless' systems. There is also a simple xHTML interface allowing basic monitoring from suitable phones! Recent versions of ZoneMinder also include optional DVR (digital video recorder) functions allowing you to pause, rewind and even digitally zoom both live and historical video.</p>

<p>There is no hard upper or lower limit to the number of cameras that ZoneMinder can support, it entirely depends on the resources available on the host PC. This means that a basic home CCTV system can often be installed on old hardware that may be lying around unused giving you DIY CCTV completely for free!</p>
